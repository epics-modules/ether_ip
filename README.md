Interfaces Allen Bradley PLCs (see www.ab.com) via Ethernet to EPICS IOCs
 * ControlLogix 5000,
   both original versions with separate controller and ENET module,
   and L8x series that includes a network port in the controller.

For EPICS R3.14.8 and higher,
on Linux and several other operating systems supported by EPICS libCom.
For earlier version of EPICS base, including R3.13, see tags/releases older than ether_ip-3-0.
VxWorks 5.5 must also use an older version because its compiler requires
K&R style declarations of all variables at the start of a code block.
